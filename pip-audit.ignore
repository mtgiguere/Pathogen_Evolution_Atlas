# CVE-2025-68463 affects Biopython 1.86.
# As of this project version, no patched Biopython release is available upstream.
#
# Risk assessment:
# - Data source is trusted (NCBI GenBank)
# - Usage is read-only parsing
# - No user-supplied or attacker-controlled inputs
# - No privileged execution context
#
# Action:
“CVE-2026-0994 tracked; waiting for upstream fix; not exploitable in our current threat model because we do not parse untrusted Protobuf JSON.”
# - Re-evaluate and remove this ignore when Biopython releases a fixed version.
