# 🧬 Pathogen Evolution Atlas

**Genomics • Geography • Machine Learning**

*A platform for tracking how pathogens evolve and spread across space and time — and predicting what comes next.*

---

## Overview

Pathogen Evolution Atlas is a genomic surveillance and forecasting system that integrates pathogen genome sequences, mutation data, collection time, and geographic metadata to model how variants emerge and spread.

The platform is designed to mirror the systems used by public health agencies, vaccine developers, and genomic surveillance teams to monitor evolutionary risk and anticipate future outbreaks.

---

## What This System Does

For each pathogen, the system produces:

- Lineage and variant tracking  
- Mutation frequency trends  
- Geographic spread maps  
- Variant growth rates  
- Short-term forecasts  
- Explainable risk scores  

Outputs can be explored through an interactive dashboard or queried via an API.

---

## Scientific Focus

This project focuses on:

- Molecular evolution  
- Mutation dynamics  
- Protein-coding changes  
- Selection pressure  
- Phylogenetic structure  

The system is grounded in biological meaning — not just statistical pattern matching.

---

## Data Sources

The platform integrates data from:

- **GISAID**
- **NCBI GenBank**
- **Nextstrain**
- (optional) public epidemiological datasets

Each genome record includes:

- Nucleotide sequence  
- Collection date  
- Geographic location  
- Lineage or variant annotation  

---

## Machine Learning

Machine learning is used to:

- Predict geographic spread of variants  
- Forecast mutation trends  
- Identify high-risk lineages  

Models include:

- Baseline linear models  
- Random forests  
- Gradient-boosted trees  

Predictions are explainable using feature importance and SHAP analysis.

## System Architecture

High-level pipeline:


The system is designed to be:

- Reproducible  
- Auditable  
- Scalable
