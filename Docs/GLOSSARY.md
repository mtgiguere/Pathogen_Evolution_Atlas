# Glossary

**Reference genome**  
A baseline genome sequence used for comparison.

**Accession**  
A unique identifier assigned to a genome record in a public database.

**Mutation**  
A nucleotide difference between a sample genome and the reference genome.

**Ambiguous base (N)**  
A nucleotide that could not be confidently determined.
Ignored to avoid false mutation counts.

**Gene**  
A region of the genome that encodes a functional biological product.

**Spike (S)**  
A viral gene involved in host cell entry.
Often associated with functional changes.

**ORF1ab**  
A large gene encoding viral replication machinery.

**Canonical record**  
A normalized representation of a genome,
independent of its original data source.

**Risk score**  
A simple, explainable numerical summary of mutation burden,
weighted by gene importance.
