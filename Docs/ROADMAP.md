# Project Roadmap

This document describes where the project is heading
and how it will evolve over time.

---

## Current stage (v0)

Implemented:
- GenBank ingestion
- Canonical genome normalization
- Mutation detection
- Gene mapping
- Explainable risk scoring
- Automated testing, linting, and security scanning

---

## Near-term goals (v1)

- End-to-end scoring script (NDJSON → scored NDJSON)
- Time-series mutation tracking
- Integration with Nextstrain data
- Basic visualizations (counts over time)

---

## Medium-term goals (v2)

- Geographic aggregation
- Variant trend analysis
- Feature extraction for machine learning
- Risk forecasting experiments

---

## Long-term vision

- Interactive atlas of pathogen evolution
- Multiple pathogens (not only SARS-CoV-2)
- Explainable ML models
- Educational and research use cases

---

## Guiding principle

Scientific clarity and explainability
will always be prioritized over black-box prediction.
